		* format: 1 byte each column, 16 columns. need offset
		* file name: <tar>\cmd-<xx>, the <xx> is the NVMe command id in the trace

	> cd tcg-parser
	
	- invoke the following commands in Powershell
	> Import-module tcg-parser.dll
	> Import-module jccmdlet.dll
	> import-uids $pwd\uids.json	
	
4. parsing
	- invoke the following command to preprocess data (once for each trace): <tat> is your data folder name
	> .\ProcessPlyload.ps1 <tar>
